# Cake User Sessions Plugin
CakePHP plugin to manage users sessions. In order to add, remove and view active sessions for a authenticated user

Normally, sessions are stored via a save-handler in for example a database or (file) cache storage interface. However, we cannot keep track of sessions belonging to a user.
This is solved by using this plugin.
